# dark-aigle

Dark Aigle has dark magic.

The library extends the native Promise, it is anti-pattern, but the Promise will have a lot of dark power.

## Usage

You just need to call this library somewhere then the native Promise will be extended.

It will have a lot of useful functions, the same as Aigle and Bluebird.

```js
require('dark-aigle');
```
